Create a Card component that represents a playing card in the game. This component can take in props such as the card's value, suit, and whether it is face up or face down.

Create a Deck component that represents the deck of cards used in the game. This component can store the deck of cards as an array of objects and include functions to shuffle the deck and deal cards to the player and dealer.

Create a Hand component that represents a player's hand in the game. This component can take in props such as the cards in the hand and whether the hand is the player's or the dealer's.

Create a Game component that will be the main component for the game. This component can manage the state of the game, including the player's hand, the dealer's hand, the current score, and whether the game is over.

Implement the logic of the game by adding event handlers to the Game component. These handlers should update the state of the game based on the player's actions (e.g. hitting or standing) and the dealer's actions (e.g. hitting until the score is above a certain threshold).

Render the Card, Deck, Hand, and Game components in the App component, which will be the top-level component.

Style game using CSS to make it look like a traditional Blackjack table.
